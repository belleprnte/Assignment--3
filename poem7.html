      <body>
      <br><br><br><br><p><div>MY MOUTH BLOSSOMS LIKE A CUT</div></p>
    <p>I've been wronged all year,</p>
    <p><h6>tedious nights,</h6></p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;nothing but <br>rough elbows in them <br>and delicate boxes <br> of Kleenex calling
<div class="baby">
  <br><br><center>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CRYBABY,
    <br><br><br><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CRYBABY,
    </strong><br><br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp; YOU FOOL!</p></center>
</div>

    <p><br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before today my body was useless. Now it's tearing at its square corners.<br>It's tearing old Mary's garments off, knot by knot.<br><br>and see--Now it's shot full of these electric bolts.<br><br>Zing! &nbsp; A resurrection!</p>
    <p>Once it was a boat, quite wooden
    <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and with no business, and no salt water under it<br><br>and in need of some paint. It was no more <br> than a group of boards <br><br><br> But you hoisted her, <strong>rigged her</strong></p>
    <p>She's been elected</p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;My nerves are turned on. </p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;I hear them like</p>
    <p>musical instruments. Where there was silence</p>
    <p>the drums, the strings are incurably playing. You did this</p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Pure genius at work. <br><br>Darling, the composer has stepped</p>into fire.
